# Basic Simulation
Simulation to apply basic tracking algorithms

# Why would you use this?
- Simple base class that can be imported to create a variert of simple simulation based on the need of the tester.
- Most videos and simulators out there are complex to understand and not ideal to implement 1st prototype tracking algothms.
- Created with pygame which is easy to use.

## Content:
- `Base.py` containing the class Sim that can be extended or modified based on the simulation scenery
